//  Becoming adept at cryptography:
//  ------------------------------
//
//  This library does not, and cannot, substitute for a good working knowledge of encryption.
//  The defaults are sensible and secure, but in ten years, things will have changed, as they
//  always do in the field of encryption.  Ideally, read Bruce Schneier's excellent "Applied
//  Cryptography," and if you enjoy the work, later also Ferguson's "Practical Cryptography"
//  and Mao's "Modern Cryptography."
//
//    first:
//      http://sc.tri-bit.com/Applied_Cryptography
//
//    then:
//      http://sc.tri-bit.com/Practical_Cryptography
//      http://sc.tri-bit.com/Modern_Cryptography
//
//  If, after time, you find you really enjoy the subject, a somewhat more difficult but
//  rather more in-depth tome is Menezes' "Handbook of Applied Cryptography," which is only
//  recommended if you've already read Schneier and have a good foundation in algorithms
//  as you'd get from reading Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming" volumes 1 and 2, or
//  Corman et al's  "Introduction to Algorithms."
//
//    eventually:
//      http://sc.tri-bit.com/Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography
//
//    and as support:
